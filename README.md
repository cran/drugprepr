An algorithm for the transparent and efficient preparation of electronic prescription data into information on individualsâ€™ drug use over time. 
The goal of the `drugprepr` package is to allow users to perform multiverse analyses in a concise and easily interpretable manner. The `drugprepr` package allows researchers to specify sets of defensible data processing options at each decision node (e.g., different ways of imputing missing quantity and daily dose, different ways of handling multiple prescriptions), implement them all, and then report the outcomes of all analyses resulting from all possible choice combinations. 
The package depends on the R package `doseminer` for extracting drug dosage information from freetext prescription data.
